# Sign in with Ethereum

**Sign in with Ethereum** (SIWE) is an authentication method for Ethereum accounts. It can be used by any kind of app, whether crypto-related or not.

## Key Benefits

### Complements other elements of the Ethereum Identity Stack

After the user authenticates, apps may use their onchain **[ENS](https://ens.domains)** username and profile and **[EFP](https://efp.app)** social graph.

### Enrich your app's UX with onchain data

Seamlessly connects user identity with onchain activities, enabling applications to verify user ownership of NFTs, tokens, and other blockchain assets.

### Self-Sovereign Identity

Users maintain control over their identity credentials, eliminating dependency on centralized identity providers like Google or Facebook.

### Single Sign-On

Works across any application that implements the SIWE standard, creating a unified authentication and account experience.


## How It Works

SIWE follows a simple authentication flow:

1. **Message Creation**: Application generates a human-readable sign-in message containing domain, address, and security parameters, following the [EIP-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) standard.
2. **User Signing**: User signs the message with the Ethereum wallet of their choice.
3. **Signature Verification**: Application verifies the signature cryptographically to authenticate the user.
4. **Session Establishment**: Upon successful verification, a secure session is created for the authenticated user.

## Open EIP standard

SIWE is defined by **[EIP-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361)** standard.

## Getting Started

Ready to implement SIWE in your application? Here are some quick paths forward:

### Quick Start

Follow our [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart/) for a step-by-step tutorial on implementing SIWE from scratch.

### TypeScript Library

The official SIWE library for JavaScript and TypeScript:

-   [TypeScript Library Documentation](/docs/libraries/typescript)

### Rust Library

The official SIWE library for Rust:

-   [Rust Library Documentation](/docs/libraries/rust)

### Ethereum Identity Kit component library and API

We offer the [Ethereum Identity Kit](https://ethidentitykit.com/) component library and API to help you integrate SIWE and the rest of the Ethereum identity stack.

### Pre-built Integrations

Get started quickly with existing integrations:

-   [Auth0](/docs/integrations/auth0)
-   [Discourse](/docs/integrations/discourse)

## Message Validator

Use our [Message Validator](/tools/validator) to check your SIWE messages for EIP-4361 compliance, security best practices, and proper formatting.

## Security First

SIWE prioritizes security through:

-   **Nonce-based replay protection** to prevent message reuse attacks
-   **Domain binding** to prevent cross-site message abuse
-   **Expiration timestamps** for time-limited authentication
-   **Best practices guidance** for secure implementation

Learn more about [Security Best Practices](/docs/security-considerations).

## Enterprise Ready

For enterprise applications, SIWE provides:

-   **[OpenID Connect (OIDC) Provider](/docs/oidc-provider/)** for standards-compliant integration
-   **Scalable authentication** supporting millions of users
-   **Compliance-friendly** audit trails and security controls
-   **Professional support** and deployment guidance

## Standards Compliance

SIWE fully complies with:

-   [EIP-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361): Sign in with Ethereum specification
-   [OpenID Connect](/docs/oidc-provider/) 1.0 for enterprise integration
-   [OAuth 2.0](/docs/integrations/auth0) for authorization flows
-   Web3 wallet standards for broad compatibility
