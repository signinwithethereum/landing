# Auth0

## Overview

Auth0 supports Sign in with Ethereum via an OpenID Connect custom social connection. This allows enterprise applications to authenticate users with their Ethereum wallets while leveraging Auth0's existing infrastructure.

## How It Works

Auth0 connects to a SIWE [OIDC Provider](/docs/oidc-provider/) as a custom social connection:

1. User clicks **Sign in with Ethereum** in your app
2. Auth0 redirects to the SIWE OIDC Provider
3. The provider prompts the user to sign a SIWE message with their wallet
4. The provider verifies the signature and returns OIDC tokens to Auth0
5. Auth0 creates a user session and redirects back to your app

The SIWE OIDC Provider handles wallet connection, message signing, and ENS resolution — Auth0 treats it as a standard OIDC identity provider.

## Setup

### 1. Deploy a SIWE OIDC Provider

You need a running instance of the [SIWE OIDC Provider](/docs/oidc-provider/). See the [Deployment Guide](/docs/oidc-provider/deployment-guide) for options.

### 2. Register with the OIDC Provider

Register Auth0 as an OIDC client. You can either:

- **Dynamic registration**: POST to the provider's `/reg` endpoint with your Auth0 callback URL
- **Default clients**: Pre-configure Auth0 as a default client via the `NUXT_OIDC_DEFAULT_CLIENTS` environment variable

Your Auth0 callback URL is typically: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/login/callback`

### 3. Configure Auth0

In your Auth0 dashboard:

1. Go to **Authentication > Social** and create a new connection
2. Choose **Create Custom** and select **OpenID Connect**
3. Configure the connection:
   - **Issuer URL**: Your OIDC provider URL (e.g., `https://oidc.yourdomain.com`)
   - **Client ID**: From the registration step
   - **Scopes**: `openid profile`
4. Enable the connection for your application

### 4. Map User Claims

The SIWE OIDC Provider returns these claims:

| Auth0 Field | OIDC Claim | Value |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| `user_id` | `sub` | `eip155:{chainId}:{address}` |
| `name` | `preferred_username` | ENS name or Ethereum address |
| `picture` | `picture` | ENS avatar URL |

## Benefits

- **Enterprise Ready**: Leverages Auth0's existing infrastructure (MFA, audit logs, compliance)
- **Standards Compliant**: Uses standard OIDC — no custom Auth0 plugins required
- **ENS Integration**: Users see their ENS name and avatar in Auth0 profiles
- **Multi-App SSO**: One SIWE sign-in works across all your Auth0 applications
