# OIDC Provider

An OpenID Connect identity provider that authenticates users with their Ethereum wallets via [Sign in with Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) (EIP-4361).

Any application that supports OIDC can use this provider to let users log in with their Ethereum address, with no passwords, no email, and no custodial accounts.

## How It Works

```
┌────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│  App   │────▶│ SIWE OIDC   │────▶│ User's Wallet │
│(Client)│◀────│  Provider   │◀────│  (MetaMask…)  │
└────────┘     └─────────────┘     └───────────────┘
  OIDC code      interaction         SIWE signature
  flow           + consent
```

1. Your app starts a standard OIDC authorization code flow (with PKCE)
2. The provider presents a wallet-connect login page
3. The user signs a [SIWE message](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361); this replaces both password entry and consent
4. The provider verifies the signature and issues OIDC tokens
5. Your app receives an ID token with the user's Ethereum identity

The user's SIWE signature **is** their consent; no additional consent screen is needed.

## Features

- Full OIDC authorization code flow with PKCE
- Dynamic client registration (`/reg` endpoint)
- Pre-configured default clients via environment variable
- ENS name and avatar resolution (returned as `preferred_username` and `picture` claims)
- Smart wallet support: EOA, EIP-1271 (contract wallets like Safe), EIP-6492 (counterfactual)
- Token introspection and revocation
- RP-Initiated Logout
- Redis-backed session storage
- Auto-generated RSA signing keys (shared safely across workers)
- Docker and Docker Compose deployment

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/signinwithethereum/oidc-provider
cd oidc-provider
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm dev
```

The provider starts at `http://localhost:3000`. Visit `http://localhost:3000/.well-known/openid-configuration` to see the OIDC discovery document.
